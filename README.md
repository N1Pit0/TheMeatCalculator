# TheMeatCalculator
This is a simple project called The meat calculatr. It serves no purose other than that i got experience from writing it. 
You as a human are choosing products to create new type of sausage. To do this you need to write product name and price of it per kg 
into their respective input fields, then press ADD to add it on a list. 
The calculators main purpose is that given price and weight of multiple products calculate average price of new kind of sausage consisting
of the products listed on the productList. Input weight of each product and press calculate to get desired result.
WARRNING!!! weight distribution is sequential.
You can start over by presiing "delete" button and start creating new sausage.
